 <br><br>The Archimedean and Plato polyhedra can be viewed in AR with the indicated markers, and through the links created on the markers, the polyhedra can be seen in VR.
<br>The AR environment was created with the <b>Jerome Etienne</b> scripts: <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js">AR.js - Augmented Reality for the Web</a>.
<br>The orbit scripts developed by <b>Till Hinrichs</b> were used on the VR pages: <a href="https://github.com/tizzle/aframe-orbit-controls-component">A-frame orbit controls component</a>.
<hr><h3>Archimedean polyhedra</h3>
 An Archimedean solid is one of the 13 solids first enumerated by Archimedes. They are the semi-regular convex polyhedra composed of regular polygons meeting in identical vertices, excluding the 5 Platonic solids and excluding the prisms and antiprisms.
<br>To view Archimedean polyhedra in AR, simply visit

with any browser with a webcam device (smartphone, tablet or notebook). 
<br>Access to the VR sites is done by clicking on the blue circle that appears on top of the marker.

<table><tr><td><h4>1. Truncated octahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/hiro.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>A truncated octahedron is constructed from a regular octahedron with side length <b>3a</b> by the removal of six right square pyramids, one from each point. These pyramids have both base side length <b>a</b> and lateral side length <b>e</b> of <b>a</b>, to form equilateral triangles. The truncated octahedron can be dissected into a central octahedron, surrounded by 8 triangular cupola on each face, and 6 square pyramids above the vertices. The truncated octahedron exists in the structure of the faujasite crystals.
 <br><b>Faces:</b> 14 | <b>Polygons:</b> 6 squares and 8 hexagons | <b>Edges:</b> 36 | <b>Vertices:</b> 24 | <b>Sphericity:</b> 0.905 | <b>Diedral angles:</b> 125°15′51″ (4-6) and 109°28′16″ (6-6).

<table><tr><td><h4>2. Truncated icosahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/kanji.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>This geometry is associated with footballs (soccer balls) typically patterned with white hexagons and black pentagons. This polyhedron can be constructed from an icosahedron with the 12 vertices truncated, such that one third of each edge is cut off at each of both ends. This creates 12 new pentagon faces, and leaves the original 20 triangle faces as regular hexagons. Thus the length of the edges is one third of that of the original edges. 
 <br><b>Faces:</b> 32 | <b>Polygons:</b> 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons | <b>Edges:</b> 90 | <b>Vertices:</b> 60 | <b>Sphericity:</b> 0.967 | <b>Diedral angles:</b> 138.1897° (6-6) and 142.62° (5-6).

<table><tr><td><h4>3. Truncated icosidodecahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/19.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>The truncated icosidodecahedron is also known as the great rhombicosidodecahedron, and if a set of all 13 Archimedean solids were constructed with all edge lengths equal, the truncated icosidodecahedron would be the largest. It has more vertices and edges than any other convex nonprismatic uniform polyhedron.
 <br><b>Faces:</b> 62 | <b>Polygons:</b> 30 squares, 20 hexagons and 12 decagons | <b>Edges:</b> 180 | <b>Vertices:</b> 120 | <b>Sphericity:</b> 0.97 | <b>Diedral angles:</b> 142.62° (6-10), 148.28° (4-10) and 159.095° (4-6).  
 <br><a href="https://paulohscwb.github.io/polyhedra/vr/truncated_icosidodecahedron.html"><img src="vr/VRaframe.PNG" width="150px"></a></td></tr></table>
<table><tr><td><h4>4. Rhombicosidodecahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/18.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>The rhombicosidodecahedron is also known as the small rhombicosidodecahedron or small dodeicosidodecahedron. If you expand an icosahedron by moving the faces away from the origin the right amount, without changing the orientation or size of the faces, and do the same to its dual dodecahedron, and patch the square holes in the result, you get a rhombicosidodecahedron. It can also be called an expanded dodecahedron or icosahedron, from truncation operations on either uniform polyhedron.
 <br><b>Faces:</b> 62 | <b>Polygons:</b> 30 squares, 20 triangles and 12 pentagons | <b>Edges:</b> 120 | <b>Vertices:</b> 60 | <b>Sphericity:</b> 0.979 | <b>Diedral angles:</b> 159°05′41″ (3-4) and 148°16′57″ (4-5).

<table><tr><td><h4>5. Snub dodecahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/17.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>The snub dodecahedron has the highest sphericity of all Archimedean solids. It has two distinct forms, which are mirror images  of each other. The union of both forms is a compound of two snub dodecahedra. The snub dodecahedron can be generated by taking the twelve pentagonal faces of the dodecahedron and pulling them outward so they no longer touch. At a proper distance this can create the rhombicosidodecahedron by filling in square faces between the divided edges and triangle faces between the divided vertices.
 <br><b>Faces:</b> 92 | <b>Polygons:</b> 80 triangles and 12 pentagons | <b>Edges:</b> 150 | <b>Vertices:</b> 60 | <b>Sphericity:</b> 0.982 | <b>Diedral angles:</b> 164°10′31″ (3-3) and 152°55′53″ (3-5).

<table><tr><td><h4>6. Truncated dodecahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/16.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>The truncated dodecahedron is used in the cell-transitive hyperbolic space-filling tessellation, the bitruncated icosahedral honeycomb. This polyhedron can be formed from a dodecahedron by truncating the corners so the pentagon faces become decagons and the corners become triangles. It is part of a truncation process between a dodecahedron and icosahedron.
 <br><b>Faces:</b> 32 | <b>Polygons:</b> 20 triangles and 12 decagons | <b>Edges:</b> 150 | <b>Vertices:</b> 60 | <b>Sphericity:</b> 0.926 | <b>Diedral angles:</b> 116.57° (10-10) and 142.62° (3-10).

 <table><tr><td><h4>7. Icosidodecahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/20.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>Icosidodecahedron contains 12 pentagons of the dodecahedron and 20 triangles of the icosahedron. The truncated cube can be turned into an icosidodecahedron by dividing the octagons into two pentagons and two triangles. The icosidodecahedron has 6 central decagons.
 <br><b>Faces:</b> 32 | <b>Polygons:</b> 20 triangles and 12 pentagons | <b>Edges:</b> 60 | <b>Vertices:</b> 30 | <b>Sphericity:</b> 0.951 | <b>Diedral angle:</b> 142.62° (5-3).

 <br><br>The snub cube has 38 faces, with 32 triangles and 6 squares. This solid has 60 edges, 24 vertices and it is also known as snub cuboctahedron. It is a chiral solid, and hence has two enantiomorphous forms known as laevo (left-handed) and dextro (right-handed).

 <hr><h3>Platonic polyhedra</h3>
 An Platonic solid is a regular and convex polyhedron. It is constructed by congruent and regular polygonal faces with the same number of faces meeting at each vertex. They are named by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato who classified that the classical elements were made from these regular solids.
