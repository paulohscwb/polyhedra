 <b>Show polyhedra in Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality</b>
 
<br>The Archimedean and Plato polyhedra can be viewed in AR with the indicated markers, and through the links created on the markers, the polyhedra can be seen in VR.
<br>The RA environment was created with the <b>Jerome Etienne</b> scripts.
<br>The orbit scripts developed by <b>Till Hinrichs</b> were used on the VR pages.
 <h3>Archimedean polyhedra</h3>
 An Archimedean solid is one of the 13 solids first enumerated by Archimedes. They are the semi-regular convex polyhedra composed of regular polygons meeting in identical vertices, excluding the 5 Platonic solids and excluding the prisms and antiprisms.
