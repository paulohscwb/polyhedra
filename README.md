 <br><br>The Archimedean, Plato, Catalan and nonconvex polyhedra can be viewed in AR with the indicated markers, and through the links created on the markers, the polyhedra can be seen in VR.
 <br>A <b>uniform polyhedron</b> has regular polygons as faces and is isogonal, that is, it has an isometry that allows the set of its vertices to correspond to each other through symmetry relations. The notation used for the <b>n<sup>th</sup></b> uniform polyhedron is <b>U<sub>n</sub></b>.
<br>The AR environment was created with the <b>Jerome Etienne</b> scripts: <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js" target="_blank">AR.js - Augmented Reality for the Web</a>.
<br>The orbit scripts developed by <b>Kevin Ngo</b> were used on the VR pages: <a href="https://github.com/supermedium/superframe/tree/master/components/orbit-controls/" target="_blank"> Orbit controls for A-Frame</a>.

 An Archimedean solid is one of the 13 solids first enumerated by Archimedes. They are the semi-regular convex polyhedra composed of regular polygons meeting in identical vertices, excluding the 5 Platonic solids and excluding the prisms and antiprisms.

These pyramids have both base side length <b>a</b> and lateral side length <b>e</b> of <b>a</b>, to form equilateral triangles. The truncated octahedron can be dissected into a central octahedron, surrounded by 8 triangular cupola on each face, and 6 square pyramids above the vertices.

This polyhedron can be constructed from an icosahedron with the 12 vertices truncated, such that one third of each edge is cut off at each of both ends. This creates 12 new pentagon faces, and leaves the original 20 triangle faces as regular hexagons. Thus the length of the edges is one third of that of the original edges.

If you expand an icosahedron by moving the faces away from the origin the right amount, without changing the orientation or size of the faces, and do the same to its dual dodecahedron, and patch the square holes in the result, you get a rhombicosidodecahedron. It can also be called an expanded dodecahedron or icosahedron, from truncation operations on either uniform polyhedron.

The union of both forms is a compound of two snub dodecahedra. The snub dodecahedron can be generated by taking the twelve pentagonal faces of the dodecahedron and pulling them outward so they no longer touch. At a proper distance this can create the rhombicosidodecahedron by filling in square faces between the divided edges and triangle faces between the divided vertices.

A faceted version is the ditrigonal dodecadodecahedron. The convex hull of the small ditrigonal icosidodecahedron is a regular dodecahedron, whose dual is the icosahedron, so the dual of the great ditrigonal dodecicosidodecahedron (the small triambic icosahedron) is one of the icosahedron stellations.
