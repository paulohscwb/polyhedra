 <br><br>The Archimedean and Plato polyhedra can be viewed in AR with the indicated markers, and through the links created on the markers, the polyhedra can be seen in VR.
<br>The RA environment was created with the <b>Jerome Etienne</b> scripts.
<br>The orbit scripts developed by <b>Till Hinrichs</b> were used on the VR pages.
<br><br>To view Archimedean polyhedra in AR, simply visit 
<p align="center"><a href="https://paulohscwb.github.io/polyhedra/archimedes.html">https://paulohscwb.github.io/polyhedra/archimedes.html</a></p> 
with any browser with a webcam device (smartphone, tablet or notebook). 
<br>Access to the VR sites is done by clicking on the blue circle that appears on top of the marker.

 <h3>Archimedean polyhedra</h3>
 An Archimedean solid is one of the 13 solids first enumerated by Archimedes. They are the semi-regular convex polyhedra composed of regular polygons meeting in identical vertices, excluding the 5 Platonic solids and excluding the prisms and antiprisms.
 <h4>1. Truncated octahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/hiro.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>Truncated octahedron has 14 faces, with 6 squares and 8 hexagons. This solid has 36 edges, 24 vertices and It was called the "mecon" by Buckminster Fuller.

 <h4>2. Truncated icosahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/kanji.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>Truncated icosahedron has 32 faces, with 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. This solid has 90 edges, 60 vertices and it is the shape used in the construction of soccer balls.

 <h4>3. Truncated icosidodecahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/19.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>Truncated icosidodecahedron has 62 faces, with 30 squares, 20 hexagons and 12 decagons. This solid has 180 edges, 120 vertices and It is also known as the great rhombicosidodecahedron.

 <h4>4. Rhombicosidodecahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/18.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>Rhombicosidodecahedron has 62 faces, with 20 triangles, 30 squares and 12 pentagons. This solid has 120 edges, 60 vertices and it is also known as the small rhombicosidodecahedron or small dodecicosidodecahedron.

 <h4>5. Snub dodecahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/17.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>Snub dodecahedron has 92 faces, with 80 triangles and 12 pentagons. This solid has 150 edges, 60 vertices and it is a chiral solid, and therefore exists in two enantiomorphous forms, commonly called laevo (left-handed) and dextro (right-handed).

 <h4>6. Truncated dodecahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/16.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>Truncated dodecahedron has 32 faces, with 20 triangles and 12 decagons. This solid has 150 edges, 60 vertices and it is used in the cell-transitive hyperbolic space-filling tessellation, the bitruncated icosahedral honeycomb.

 <h4>7. Icosidodecahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/20.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>Icosidodecahedron has 32 faces, with 20 triangles and 12 pentagons. This solid has 60 edges, 30 vertices and it is contains 12 pentagons of the dodecahedron and 20 triangles of the icosahedron.

<h4>8. Snub cube</h4>
 <img src="ar/15.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>Snub cube has 38 faces, with 32 triangles and 6 squares. This solid has 60 edges, 24 vertices and it is also known as snub cuboctahedron. It is a chiral solid, and hence has two enantiomorphous forms known as laevo (left-handed) and dextro (right-handed).

 <h4>9. Truncated cuboctahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/14.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>Truncated cuboctahedron has 26 faces, with 12 squares, 8 hexagons and 6 octagons. This solid has 72 edges, 48 vertices and it is also known as great rhombicuboctahedron. There is only one uniform coloring of the faces of this polyhedron, one color for each face type.

 <h4>12. Cuboctahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/11.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>Cuboctahedron has 14 faces, with 8 triangles and 6 squares. This solid has 24 edges, 12 vertices and appears in the lower left as one of the polyhedral "stars" in M. C. Escher's 1948 wood engraving "Stars".

 <h4>13. Truncated tetrahedron</h4>
 <img src="ar/10.png" width="180px">
 <br><br>Truncated tetrahedron has 8 faces, with 4 triangles and 4 hexagons. This solid has 18 edges, 12 vertices. The Tetraminx puzzle has a truncated tetrahedral shape. This puzzle shows a dissection of a truncated tetrahedron into 4 octahedra and 6 tetrahedra.
